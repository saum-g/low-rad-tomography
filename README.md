# low-rad-tomography
In this repository we will implement prior based tomographic reconstruction based on the paper "Low radiation tomographic reconstruction with and without template information"

Points to work on in future:
1) Lower the intensity of Re-irradiation
2) Presentation should be better and all images should be plotted on the same scale.
3) Poisson Noise related thing in step 4 of main algorithm of reconstruction with priors.
